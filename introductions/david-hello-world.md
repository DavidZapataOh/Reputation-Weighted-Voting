## About You and The Course

**What do you hope to get from the course?** i.e. what are specific things that you want to learn or accomplish by June 05, 2024?
I am a blockchain developer with 2 years of experience. My specialty is creating custom ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. Recently, I have wanted to see the other side of the coin, the strategies to keep the value of a token stable or growing. I am also interested in how DAOs work; I am currently part of one, and I have always wanted to know what models exist and which might be better depending on the use case.

**What do you hope to give to the course?** i.e. what are specific things that you could do to support the instructors and students (while also supporting your own goals)?
I always like to contribute in the communities where I join, unfortunately my level of spoken English is very poor, which makes it difficult for me to help. I will be happy to be of service in everything related to programming or smart contracts, besides contributing some ideas.
